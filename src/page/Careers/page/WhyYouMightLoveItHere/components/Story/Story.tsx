                  What does the average day-to-day actually look like for an

                  wondered about that. And for good reason, because there’s only

                  Visitors on our careers page may have noticed that whenever we
                  have an opening for an artist, we’ve hardly ever had one for
                  an Art Director . Well, sometimes we have, but we’ve used
                  quotation marks around the title: “Art Director”. Because that
                  is, and at the same time is not, what we are looking for.

                  Supercell doesn’t really have any junior artists on board, at

                  a few notches in their belt and could easily call themselves
                  “senior artists”. Many are hardened industry veterans, the
                  kind of people who would have been promoted past the daily
                  grind of crafting art in most other companies, and into
