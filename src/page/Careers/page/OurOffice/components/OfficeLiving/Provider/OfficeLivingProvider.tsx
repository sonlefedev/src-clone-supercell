In 2018, we took a big step as a company as Shanghai became the site for our first game studio outside Helsinki. The goal for our developers in Shanghai and in Helsinki is exactly the same: to create globally appealing games that are played for years and remembered forever. This is our opportunity to bring together the best of two different worlds.`,

The team spent a few years in shared startup spaces until moving into their permanent home in the heart of the Financial District sheltering 40 professionals from brand marketers to data scientists. In December 2021, we announced that we are setting up a new game development studio in North America with the dream of making games not expected from us.`,
