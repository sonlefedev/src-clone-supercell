            It’s a poorly kept secret that Supercell’s first office was a snug
            35m2 room that had to fit 15 people, their laptops and a
            coffee-maker. Eventually the CEO moved his desk (a cardboard box at
            the time) out into the hallway to free up some space. In 2021, after
            outgrowing a number of locations around Helsinki, we opened our own,
            custom-designed office on the seafront, just south of the city
            center.

            The Helsinki office is home to over 250 passionate professionals
            from various backgrounds and walks of life. Arounds two thirds of us
            are directly involved with making games. In addition to five live
            teams of roughly 10-25 people each, we have numerous new game teams
            at prototype stage working in pairs, trios and more. We mostly stick
            to speaking in English for work, but you’ll hear chatter in
            languages from all over the world around the office.

            Every week starts with a company breakfast while on Fridays we get
            together for an all-hands gathering to share game updates and
            company news. This often gives way to refreshments, play sessions
            and casual conversations.
